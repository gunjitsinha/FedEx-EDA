# FedEx Logistics Performance Analysis

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of FedEx shipment records from 2005 to 2015, focusing on the global distribution of vaccines and medical equipment.

## What Was Done
- Cleaned and explored shipment-level data
- Handled hidden and explicit missing values
- Analyzed numerical distributions and outliers
- Interpreted categorical patterns across logistics
- Conducted multivariate comparisons by delivery mode and geography

## Dataset
Shipment records managed by FedEx between 2005–2015, covering global vaccine and medical equipment deliveries.

## Key Findings
- Hidden missing values affected up to 56% of some columns.
- Numerical features were highly skewed with low-probability outliers.
- Some categorical data had low cardinality, which suggested centralized operations.
- Most deliveries were handled by a single team, limiting comparative insights.
- Air and ocean deliveries showed opposing trends in delay likelihood.
- Insurance amounts closely followed shipment value — not weight or cost.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Regex
- Jupyter Notebook
